Custom built dance pad for the arcade dance game Pump it Up. Built using mainly wood and 3D printed parts.

Features acrylic pads, each with LED lighting, and an Arduino controller that emulates a USB HID game controller.

Post structure:

- Explain PIU and picture of real pad, plus gameplay ss
- Go through all features
- Go through custom parts, all 3D printed parts
- Difficulties, like sensor versions and wear
- Go through BOM and rough cost
- Link to GitHub repo with instructions and links to 3D files (very much TODO)
- Pictures of build process and close up on parts of it
